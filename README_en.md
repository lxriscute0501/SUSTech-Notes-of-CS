## Introduction

As a student from **Department of Mathematics**, I took some mathematics compulsory courses. After that however, my desire to switch to **computer science** has reached its peak üòÅ Therefore, this repository can only contain most of the compulsory courses for CS and a few optional courses. For the parts that I cannot directly select courses for, the materials are from friends in the Computer Science Department (I have noted and expressed gratitude in the introduction section of such courses). 

My course selection plan is rather chaotic. For students majoring in engineering who want to take more courses in Computer Science or those who wish to pursue a "double major" in Computer Science and Mathematics, the curriculum plan of the Computer Science Department is more suitable for reference. Of course, if you have spare time, it is recommended to take the four basic courses (*DSAA, Computer Organization, Computer Networks, Operating Systems*) in the lower grades.

## PS

For all the LabOJ sections, we have made every effort to supplement the problem descriptions. Thus, even if the problems change with the years, the codes will still retain their reference value and achieve the effect of self-study!

>[!warning]
> The assignments on labOJ may be very similar every year, even the same. But **please do not copy the code directly**! This will cause problems with the plagiarism check (even if it's a WA code, it will still be checked for plagiarism, so don't try to test it first), and it will also hinder your code-writing ability. Besides, I hope these codes can help you **AC**!

## Conclusion

It can be said that the professional courses in the Computer Science Department are almost all courses that can be completed with **full marks except for exams**. However, the real ability is directly proportional to the time spent. Just like the course projects, their proportion in the overall grade is **extremely low** (compared to the time spent), but completing a project with a complete function and clear logic is of great benefit to the understanding of principles and working ability. 

As an ordinary student at SUSTech, I cannot guarantee that every program is 100% correct (there are a few questions that were fixed after the OJ evaluation). üòê So if you find any issues, ranging from the code logic to spelling mistakes of words, you can directly raise them in the **Issue**. If there are any supplementary courses or additional materials for existing courses, please **Pull Request**. Thank you for your contribution! üôè

May this repository be of greatest help to you!
