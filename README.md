# SUSTech-Notes-of-CS

## Introduction

Because the contributor, lxr, major in **Mathematics**, it's impossible for me to study all the required courses of Computer Science major. However, I will do my best to make this repository more complete. If you have any course meterials which is not included here, you can just send me an email via `lixuanran798@gmail.com` directly. Much appreciation for any contribution!

> The lab practices and assignments might be very similar, even the same, in nearby years, but please **DO NOT** copy the code directly, especially submit the code on OJ! Hope you can do it by yourself and get "AC"!

## Conclusion

As a normal SUSTech student, lxr can not make sure that every program is 100% correct:( So if you find any problem (it can be some details in code, illogical analysis, or even a wrong grammar), just contact me or contribute to this repository directly. Wish this could help you, especially who are not in CS major but want to take some CS courses as optional courses!
