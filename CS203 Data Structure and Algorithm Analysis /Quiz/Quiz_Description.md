## Quiz 1

There are 4 problems in total. However, Problem 1 & 4 contain several multiple choice and fill in the blanks, which is not easy to recall exactly. 
Fortunately, Problem 2 & 3 are both algorithm problems and more informative. Here is their description.

### Problem 2   [Rotate Array](https://leetcode.cn/problems/rotate-array/description/)

> Same as **LeetCode 189**, just change "rotate" to "exchange"

Given an integer array `nums`, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is non-negative.    
Example: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], k = 3, and the answer is [5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]. 


### Problem 3   [Kth Largest Element in an Array](https://leetcode.cn/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/description/)

> Same as **LeetCode 215**

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the `kth` largest element in the array.     
Note that it is the `kth` largest element in the sorted order, not the `kth` distinct element.
