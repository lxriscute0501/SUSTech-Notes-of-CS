## A. Eating Ordering

### Description

K‘, is a well-known character in The King of Fighters series developed by SNK. 
Dateri likes K' so he likes number `k`. 
One day he enters a restaurant and orders `n` dishes. 
He wants to eat them one by one.
He has an idea to decide the order of eating: 
Dishes are in a circle, numbered from `1` to `n` in clockwise direction. 
Dateri begins counting at dish `1` and proceeds around the circle in clockwise direction.
When he skips `k − 1` dishes, he will eat the next dish. 
The procedure is repeating until there is no dishes.
You should output the ordering of dishes Dateri eats.
