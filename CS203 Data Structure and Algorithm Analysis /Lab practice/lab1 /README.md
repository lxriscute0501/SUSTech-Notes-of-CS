## A. Binary Search

### Description

Given a nondecreasing sequence `a` with length `n`. We want to know whether integer `x` in the array `a` or not.  

### Input

The 1st line is a positive integer `n (1 <= n <= 100000)`.

The 2nd line contains `n` integers: `a1, a2, ...,an`. For each `ai (0 <= ai <= 1e9)`.

The 3rd line is a positive integer `T (1 <= T <= 100000)` which is the number of test case.

Then T lines follow. Each contains an integer `x (1 <= x <= 1e9)` for a test case.

### Output

For each test case, print **"YES"** (in a single line, without quotes) if `x` is in `a`, otherwise print **"NO"**.


### Sample Input
```
4
1 2 3 999999
2

3
```

### Sample Output
```
